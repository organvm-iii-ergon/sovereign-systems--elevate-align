/**
 * Aesthetics Vocabulary — shared language for the Sovereign Systems Spiral.
 *
 * This file defines every named aesthetic / structural / visual / linguistic
 * primitive in the project, so that the client (Maddie) and the studio (us)
 * share one vocabulary when talking about specific parts. Each term has:
 *
 *   - a *public name* (what Maddie uses)
 *   - a *technical name* in parens (what the codebase uses)
 *   - a one-sentence definition (no jargon)
 *   - an *example* (concrete instance, so the term lands)
 *   - an optional *link* (where the thing can be inspected on the live site)
 *
 * The page at `/aesthetics` renders this vocabulary alongside live data from
 * `hub.config.ts`, `icon-worlds.ts`, `sacred-geometry-primitives.ts`,
 * `lens-geometry.ts`, and `naming-chains.ts`. Add a term here when a new
 * concept enters the system and we need shared language for it.

    definition: 'One of three stages of the journey arc: ELEVATE (nodes 1–5, raising from baseline), ALIGN (nodes 6–10, integrating mind and life), UNLOCK (nodes 11–13, freedom and full flow). Phases are the temporal arc; pillars are the topical categorization.',

    definition: 'How each spiral node renders its substrate. Four modes available — invisible (only the particle field is visible), visible (opaque solid mesh), refracted-star (prismatic glass-like material with light dispersion), hybrid (mesh plus 30% particle field on top, the current default).',
    example: 'Try ?vessel=refracted-star on the homepage URL for the prismatic look without redeploying.',

    technicalName: 'chakraColorForNode',
    category: 'visual',
    definition: 'The thirteen-step color spectrum applied to nodes bottom-to-top. Root chakra (red) through crown (violet) and beyond. The mapping lives in spiral.ts and drives orb colors, accent tones, and the timeline of warm-to-cool through the helix.',
    example: 'Node 1 is red (root); node 7 is green (heart); node 13 is violet-gold (crown).',
  },
  {
    publicName: 'Themed World',
    technicalName: 'IconWorld',
    category: 'physics',
    definition: 'The complete environment that each node inhabits — its elements (fire, water, plasma, etc.), phase mix (gas/liquid/solid/plasma proportions), biology type (cosmic, organic, mineral, aquatic, lunar, volcanic, synthetic), gravity vector, particle behavior pattern, accent palette, thermal intensity, and particle size bias. Every node is its own complete world.',
    example: 'Node 4 — Volcanic Pyre — fire + lava + smoke, rising particles, hot red-orange palette, gravity pointing upward (heat lift).',
  },
  {
    publicName: 'Sacred Geometry Primitive',
    technicalName: 'MathPrimitive',
    category: 'physics',
    definition: 'The mathematical foundation of each node form: vertex count, symmetry type (radial, bilateral, crystalline, fractal), golden-ratio exponent, inner-radius ratio, rotation-per-segment, twist factor, presence of a central void, depth-to-radius ratio. The "Platonic essence" of the form — not what it looks like, but what mathematical law generates it.',
    example: 'OCULUS: 16 vertices, radial symmetry, PHI^1, has a central void (the pupil), 0.55 inner ratio.',
