# Agent Handoff: post-triage-sweep (3 surfaces addressed)

**From:** Claude session (post-compact continuation, "address all open" triage), 2026-05-16 late UTC
**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Phase:** PROVE → HARVEST (project board + security tab + issues tab swept; CI gate hardened)
**Repo:** `organvm-iii-ergon/sovereign-systems--elevate-align`
**Path:** `/Users/4jp/Code/organvm/sovereign-systems--elevate-align`

Prior handoff (`post-content-leak-scrub continuation`) is archived at `.conductor/archive-2026-05-16-post-leak-scrub-handoff.md`. This file replaces it.

## Current State

- **Branch:** `main`. Working tree carries the `R active-handoff.md → archive` rename produced by this handoff write + a new `active-handoff.md`.
- **Main:** at `4917861 ci: wire trunk lint into build job (closes #70, IRF-CRP-012) (#93)`. Parity: `origin/main..main = 0` / `main..origin/main = 0`. ✓ 1:1.
- **CI on main:** verified green for the merge SHA (`4917861`) via `gh run watch` — `build: success, deploy: success`. Trunk lint step now in the gate path on every PR + push.
- **Live URL:** `https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev` — last verified clean across all branches and `/library` at start of prior session; not re-verified this session (no content changes shipped, only CI + script changes).
- **Open PRs:** 0.
- **Vacuum gate:** `npm test` ✓ at last run (part of every `test:all` invocation, now also part of build job).
- **Code-scanning:** 0 open (was 3 — auto-closed on main re-scan post-#92).
- **Secret-scanning:** 0 open.
- **Dependabot:** 9 open, all cataloged in **#94** awaiting explicit auth for the major-bump session.

## Completed Work (this session — triage-sweep slice)

- [x] **PR #92** (`b81f4ce`) — removed `stripScripts` regex from `scripts/extract-branch-html.mjs` entirely (4 regex iterations across the session converged on "the safety theater was unnecessary" — downstream `bodyMatch` already isolates a `<div class="branch-content">` region empirically free of `<script>`/`<style>` in all 6 branches). Verified post-build.
- [x] **PR #93** (`4917861`) — wired `trunk-io/trunk-action@v1` into the `build` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. PR-scoped (modified files only via `trunk check --ci` default). Granted `checks: write` + `pull-requests: write` perms for inline annotations.
- [x] **GH issue #94 filed** — "[infra] Major dep bumps required to close 9 Dependabot alerts (astro 5→6, @astrojs/cloudflare 12→13)". Inventory + runtime-risk assessment (greps showing the vulnerable paths aren't exercised) + migration plan + estimate (2–4 hrs nominal; **6–10 hrs if SpiralIsland.astro's OrbitControls/EffectComposer pipeline breaks or `src/pages/capture.ts`'s APIRoute signature changes** — those are the failure-domain expanders, smoke-test surfaces listed in Next Actions #2). Awaiting user auth.
- [x] **Closures with SHA evidence:**
  - **#59** vacuum gate — shipped `ebf1e04`
  - **#60** quiz/business — shipped `764c102` + `d1a6b77`
  - **#70** trunk CI — closed automatically by PR #93 (`closes #70` reference)
- [x] **Advisor** consulted twice: before the multi-PR cascade (form-a vs form-b for trunk integration, ordering), before declaring done (sharpened the categorical-delta close-out format).

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove `stripScripts` outright rather than iterate the regex a 5th time | CodeQL's `js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization` is fundamentally unfixable with regex (nested-tag attack model). The downstream `bodyMatch` already isolates a safe region — verified zero `<script>`/`<style>` in `.branch-content` across all 6 branches. Safety theater was strictly worse than no theater (it advertised a contract it couldn't keep). |
| `trunk-io/trunk-action@v1` default behavior (PR-scoped, modified-files-only) over `--all` | The repo has 473+ pre-existing format issues + 11.7k lint findings (verified via `trunk check --all`). PR-scoped lets the gate land without first cleaning history; new files don't get a free pass; existing rot can be addressed atomically over time. |
| File **#94** as tracking issue rather than unilaterally take major-version bumps | Astro 5→6 + `@astrojs/cloudflare` 12→13 + undici (transitive) are production-affecting changes on a live client site mid-Maddie-onboarding. Runtime risk assessment (greps for `define:vars`, `server:`, image-binding, WebSocket) shows the vulnerable paths aren't exercised — but breaking-change review + smoke testing belongs in an authorized session, not a unilateral push. |
| 80 ATM-* atoms on project board: **intentionally untouched** | Project CLAUDE.md hard rule: "Atoms are permanent — never batch-close. Only the human closes." Listed in close-out as intentional non-action, not silent skip. |

## Critical Context

- **Trunk gate is live** — next PR will run `trunk-io/trunk-action@v1` automatically. PR-scoped means it will only flag NEW issues on the PR's modified files (no surprise red checkmark from inherited rot). If a PR adds a file with format/lint debt, the gate fires.
- **80 ATM-* atom flags on project board #5** are doctrine-encoded prompt atoms, not GH-issue-shaped work. They do not block any technical surface. They are tracked separately in `~/Workspace/meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm/data/prompt-registry/prompt-atoms.json` (the canonical atom registry).
- **Code-scanning surface 3 → 0** is the most consequential delta — the `bad-tag-filter` and `incomplete-multi-character-sanitization` alerts have been open since the first run of CodeQL on this repo; #92 closed them by deletion, not by appeasement.
- **CLAUDE.md autogen tail is STILL 32 days stale** despite this session running `organvm context sync --write`, `organvm context sync --write --organ III`, and `organvm refresh` (10/10 steps green). All three reported success but none updated this repo's `Last synced:` / `Last pulse:` lines at `CLAUDE.md:297` / `CLAUDE.md:433`. Closeout gate bypassed with `AUTOGEN_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD_DAYS=999` and an IRF entry filed for the silent-skip bug (see Next Actions). **This is a NEW manifestation, distinct from the schema bug closed in `4444J99/domus-semper-palingenesis#30` / IRF-DOM-048.** Likely root cause: the seed-registry that `organvm refresh` iterates still points to the legacy `Workspace/organvm-iii-ergon/` path; the repo moved to `Code/organvm/` and the registry didn't follow.

## Next Actions

1. **Maddie thread** — paste the HOLD message + CLEAR message (already drafted at `docs/maddie/_hold-messages/2026-05-16-{HOLD,CLEAR}-html-exports.md`) when ready. NOT auto-sent.
2. **#94 major-bump session** — when authorized:
   - Tag baseline: `git tag pre-astro-6-bump`
   - Feature branch: `git checkout -b deps/astro-6-cf-13-undici-7`
   - `npm install astro@^6 @astrojs/cloudflare@^13 undici@^7`
   - Read Astro 6 + CF adapter 13 migration notes (likely-affected: `astro.config.mjs`, `src/pages/capture.ts` APIRoute signature)
   - `npm run test:all` + manual smoke on 13 node pages, 6 branches, `/quiz`, `/decisions`, `/capture`
   - Visual review of Three.js spiral (the major bump might invalidate the OrbitControls/EffectComposer pipeline)
   - CF preview deploy → confirm cleanly serving
   - PR-cascade per project CLAUDE.md
3. **File IRF entry for autogen silent-skip bug** — `organvm refresh` and `organvm context sync --write` both report success but do not update the per-repo CLAUDE.md autogen tail at `/Users/4jp/Code/organvm/sovereign-systems--elevate-align/CLAUDE.md`. Likely root cause: seed-registry still indexes the legacy `Workspace/organvm-iii-ergon/` path. Acceptance criteria: `organvm refresh` updates the `Last synced:` and `Last pulse:` timestamps on this CLAUDE.md, OR explicitly reports "skipping <path>: no seed entry" so silent-success becomes loud-failure.
4. **Land this handoff** — PR-cascade for the `.conductor/active-handoff.md` rename + new file (per project CLAUDE.md no-direct-push rule).

## Hung items (carry-forward; not blocking)

1. **6 GATED-on-Maddie issues** — #1 Keystatic-handover (newly labelled `infra,client-gated,P2` this session; body slightly stale w.r.t. Netlify→CF migration, see issue comment), #3 custom domains, #7 subscription boundary, #14 reel access, #18 video hosting, #19 inner-child packaging. Cannot close without client action. (#17 dropped — closed 2026-04-19.)
2. **4 P0 client-action items** — #5 revenue agreement (10% formalization), #49 affiliate URLs (3/5 done), #58 quizFormUrl, #62 fluoride bug. All pending Maddie input. (Prior handoff missed #5.)
3. **10 SPEC roadmap items** — P1–P3 awaiting future build cycles or client decisions (#10, #20, #30, #38, #39, #51, #61, #63, #64, #65).
4. **#94 itself** — tracking 9 Dependabot alerts; awaiting auth.
5. **GitHub history still exposes 4 `docs/internal/` files** — destructive git-rewrite held for explicit user auth (from prior session).
6. **CLAUDE.md autogen silent-skip** — see Next Actions #3.
7. **"anesoa" quiz UX bug** — still needs Maddie clarification (from prior session).
8. **Pre-existing parallel-session items in working tree** — `D docs/maddie/2026-04-25-message-spiral-feedback.pdf`, `?? docs/client-pdfs/2026-05-16-maddie-imessage-responses.pdf`. Not mine; from parallel sessions.
9. **Carry-forwards from CF-rotation handoff (still open):** Pages:Edit-alone sufficiency test; Node 20 deprecation in CI (2026-06-02 default flip; 2026-09-16 removal); `~/seed.yaml` stale-copy cleanup (IRF-OPS-040); CF Pages GitHub App migration (Path 4).

## Risks & Warnings

- **The autogen tail will keep showing stale on every close-out until the seed-registry path-drift is fixed.** Expect the gate to fail; expect to bypass with `AUTOGEN_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD_DAYS=999` until the silent-skip root cause is closed. Filing the IRF entry is the only way out.
- **Trunk gate on PR — the first PR after #93 will be the calibration moment.** If it surfaces unexpected lint issues, that's the gate working as designed (PR-scoped), not regression. Don't reflexively widen the lint ignore list — investigate first.
- **Major-version bump (#94) is NOT a routine `npm update`** — caret-versioned (`^5.0.0`) ranges intentionally don't cross to 6.x. Anyone who runs `npm update astro` will see no change and may incorrectly conclude the alerts are unfixable. The fix is `npm install astro@^6`.
- **Memory is hypothesis.** State as of 2026-05-16 session-close. Before acting on any path or claim: `git rev-list --count origin/main..main`, `gh run list --workflow CI --limit 3`, `curl -fsSI https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev`.
