# Agent Handoff: post-astro-6-migration

**From:** Claude session (remote container, web), 2026-05-25
**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Phase:** HARVEST (Astro 6 + Pages CMS migration shipped, deployed, runtime-verified; handoff catch-up + carry-forwards)
**Repo:** `organvm-iii-ergon/sovereign-systems--elevate-align`
**Branch:** `claude/closeout-content-leak-scrub-cw0hm` (PR #105 — originally a post-content-leak-scrub handoff refresh; rebased onto current `main` and repurposed to capture the migration per owner request)

Prior handoff (`post-transcription-audit-gap-closure`, 2026-05-17) is archived at `.conductor/archive-2026-05-17-post-transcription-audit-handoff.md`. This file replaces it.

## Why this handoff was repurposed

PR #105 was opened 2026-05-18 to refresh the active handoff after the content-leak-scrub closure (#84/#85/#86). It listed the Astro 6 / `@astrojs/cloudflare` 13 major bumps as a deferred carry-forward (tracked under Dependabot #94). Between then and 2026-05-25 that migration **landed on `main`**, so the PR's handoff became stale — it described as "blocked" work that is now done. Per owner direction (2026-05-25), the branch was rebased onto current `main` (HEAD `328f4e9`) and the handoff rewritten to reflect the post-migration reality. The content-leak-scrub durables it originally referenced were already merged (#84/#85/#86) and the post-leak-scrub handoff was already archived at `.conductor/archive-2026-05-16-post-leak-scrub-handoff.md`.

## Current State

- **Main HEAD:** `328f4e9 ci: bump actions/checkout + setup-node to v6 for Node 24 compatibility (#106)`. This branch was reset to that commit; the handoff rotation is the only delta.
- **Migration status:** Astro 6 + Pages CMS migration **complete, merged, deployed, runtime-verified** (capture / library / content pages) per the migration session (2026-05-24 → 2026-05-25). Canonical docs (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md / README) refreshed in `93f83fe`.
- **Dependency baseline (`package.json` on `main`):** `astro ^6.0.0`, `@astrojs/cloudflare 13.5.4`, `@astrojs/markdoc 1.0.5`, `three 0.184.0`; `overrides` pin `vite ^7.3.3` + `yaml ^2.9.0`; `engines.node >=22.18`.
- **CMS:** Keystatic removed (`keystatic.config.ts` gone); **Pages CMS** config now lives at `.pages.yml`.
- **Tooling:** Prettier baseline added (`.prettierrc.json` + `.prettierignore`). `.conductor/`, `docs/`, and `*.md` are prettier-ignored — coordination markdown is governed by markdownlint via Trunk, not prettier.
- **`npm audit`:** 0 vulnerabilities (cleared during the migration; Dependabot #94's 9 alerts resolved).
- **CI:** runs Trunk lint (PR-scoped, modified files only) + `npm run test:all` on Node 22, `actions/checkout@v6` + `actions/setup-node@v6`. This repo's branch protection does not block merge on required checks; CI historically runs post-merge as observer.
- **Live URL:** `https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev` — verified by the migration session; not re-curled this session.

## Resolved by the migration (previously open carry-forwards)

- [x] **Astro 6 / `@astrojs/cloudflare` 13 major bumps** (was carry-forward #3 in the post-leak-scrub handoff; Dependabot #94) — done.
- [x] **Node 20 deprecation in CI** (was carry-forward; 2026-06-02 default flip, 2026-09-16 removal) — CI actions bumped to v6 and Node pinned to 22; resolved ahead of the deadline (#106).
- [x] **`npm audit` / Dependabot #94** (9 alerts) — cleared to 0.
- [x] **Keystatic → Pages CMS** — Keystatic was the prior blocker on the migration scoping (`e921bfc`); replaced.

## v13 regressions found + fixed during migration (context for future build work)

- **Capture bindings:** Astro v6 removed `locals.runtime.env`; `src/pages/capture.ts` now reads bindings via `cloudflare:workers` (`6e09e12`).
- **/library route:** repaired under `workerd` (`node:fs` access); dropped the v13 `IMAGES` binding default (`def6f50`).
- **SESSION KV binding:** opted out of the v13 default; Pages CMS config completed (`f1536f9`).
- **Session driver:** switched to the `sessionDrivers.memory()` factory (`35a547c`).

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Repurpose PR #105 (post-content-leak-scrub handoff) into a post-migration handoff | Owner flagged the original handoff as stale (Astro 6 listed deferred but done on `main`). Refresh-on-this-branch chosen over close-as-superseded. |
| Reset branch to `origin/main` HEAD rather than a literal `git rebase` replay | The single original commit only touched `active-handoff.md` (now fully rewritten) and an archive file that already exists identically on `main`; a replay would only produce conflicts. Reset + fresh write is the clean realization of "rebase onto main + rewrite". |
| Archive the post-transcription-audit handoff under its own dated filename | Preserves the standing handoff-lineage convention (each active handoff archives its predecessor). |

## Still-open carry-forwards (NOT resolved by the migration)

1. **GitHub history exposure** — 4 relocated `docs/internal/` files remain in commit history (relocated, not destructively rewritten). Destructive `git filter-repo` still held for explicit per-session owner authorization.
2. **CLAUDE.md autogen tail staleness (IRF-OPS-050)** — registry path-drift after repo relocation (`~/Workspace/...` → `~/Code/...`); the `claude-md-autogen-gate` exits RED on the host. Host-scope; out of remote-container reach. Unblock procedure documented in `.claude/plans/2026-05-17-handoff-irf-ops-050-unblock.md` (untracked carry-forward).
3. **Pages:Edit-alone sufficiency test** — `docs/runbooks/cf-token-rotation.md` "Open question": whether the CF token needs `Account Settings:Read` or `Pages:Edit` alone suffices for `wrangler pages deploy`.
4. **CF Pages GitHub App migration (Path 4)** — auto-deploy-on-push still relies on the wrangler-action + `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret (see GH#52 history).
5. **Client-gated items awaiting Maddie** — `ghl-booking-url` (no `bookingUrl` field on `hub.config.ts` yet), affiliate URLs (#49), quizFormUrl (#58), fluoride discriminator (#62), Keystatic-handover #1 (body now stale — CMS is Pages CMS, not Keystatic), custom domains (#3), and the remaining GATED issues (#5/#7/#14/#18/#19).
6. **"anesoa" quiz UX bug** — still needs Maddie clarification.

## Verification (this session)

- Did NOT re-run `npm run build` / `npm run test:all` or re-curl the live URL — this session only rotated the `.conductor/` handoff markdown (prettier-ignored; not scanned by the vacuum gate). Build/test/runtime correctness rests on the migration session's verification + `main` CI.
- Confirmed against `origin/main`: `package.json` deps, absence of `keystatic.config.ts`, presence of `.pages.yml`, and the migration commit chain above.

## Next Actions

```bash
# 1. Confirm CI is green on this branch's handoff commit (lint-only delta expected)
#    via MCP github tools: pull_request_read get_check_runs on PR #105

# 2. Owner reads the new .conductor/active-handoff.md and confirms it matches host-side intent

# 3. Merge PR #105 (squash) once confirmed — lands the post-migration handoff on main
```

## Risks & Warnings

- **Don't push to `main` directly on this public ORGANVM repo without explicit per-session authorization.** PR-cascade always.
- **Don't force-push history rewrites without explicit owner authorization.** The 4 leaked `docs/internal/` files are a content-IP exposure in history, not a live-build vulnerability — treat as a separate, deliberate operation.
- **Remote container is ephemeral.** Anything not committed + pushed dies with the container.
- **Memory is hypothesis.** State as of 2026-05-25. Before acting: `git rev-list --count origin/main..main`, `pull_request_read get_status` on any open PR, and a curl of the live URL are your fact-checks.

## Recovery Protocol (if state has drifted on resumption)

1. `git log --oneline -5` — verify `main` HEAD is `328f4e9` or a descendant.
2. `git show origin/main:package.json | grep astro` — verify `astro ^6.0.0` (migration intact, not reverted).
3. `ls .pages.yml` — verify Pages CMS config present (Keystatic stays gone).
4. Via MCP github tools: confirm PR #105 state (merged → handoff landed; open → still in flight).
