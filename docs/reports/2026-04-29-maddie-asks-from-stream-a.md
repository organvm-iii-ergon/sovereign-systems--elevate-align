# Maddie Asks — Stream A Close-Out (2026-04-29)

This memo consolidates every decision/answer needed from Maddie that surfaced during Stream A's "generative-maximalist" build of the spiral, quiz, nav, and capture infrastructure. Each item is **non-blocking** (the work shipped without it) — Maddie's input promotes one variant to the build-time default or unlocks an optional sink.

All variants are **live now** at https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev (alias of latest deploy `https://efce9fbe.sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev`). Picking is done by visiting the URLs and feeling the difference.

---

## A) Spiral vessel mode — pick the default

Four modes are wired and reachable via querystring. Walk through each in order and pick the one that should ship as the homepage default:

| Mode | URL | What you'll see |
|---|---|---|
| invisible (current) | https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/?vessel=invisible | Particle field is the icon; no outline mesh |
| visible | https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/?vessel=visible | Solid icon shapes (texture-mapped) |
| refracted-star | https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/?vessel=refracted-star | Prismatic refractive star geometry; glassy |
| hybrid | https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/?vessel=hybrid | Solid icon outline + dimmed particle field inside |

**To promote your pick:** edit `src/data/hub.config.ts` line ~93 — change `ui.spiralVesselMode` to one of `'invisible' | 'visible' | 'refracted-star' | 'hybrid'`. The other three modes stay accessible via `?vessel=` after the change.

Closure tracker: IRF-III-033 / GH#57. Full design memo: `docs/proofs/spiral-vessel-variants/2026-04-29-IRF-III-033-comparison.md`.

---

## B) Nav variant — pick the default

| Variant | URL | What you'll see |
|---|---|---|
| pillar-first (current) | https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/?nav=pillar-first | Water · Inner · Identity · Business · Research |
| spiral-first | https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/?nav=spiral-first | Spiral · Elevate · Align · Unlock · Research |

Same item count (5). Different mental model: pillar-first foregrounds the 4-pillar structure; spiral-first foregrounds the 13-node phase journey. Mobile drawer mirrors the choice (spiral-first opens a phase-grouped list of all 13 nodes).

**To promote your pick:** edit `src/data/hub.config.ts` line ~98 — change `ui.navVariant` to `'pillar-first'` or `'spiral-first'`.

Closure tracker: IRF-III-032. Full memo: `docs/proofs/nav-variants/2026-04-29-IRF-III-032-comparison.md`.

## C) Quiz copy review

The new node-placement quiz at https://sovereign-systems-spiral.pages.dev/quiz works end-to-end (5 questions → result panel → optional capture). The 5 question prompts and their option phrasings are written in your voice (terse, frank, no apology), but you should review:

- Q1 "Where does your energy want to start?"
- Q2 "Which pillar feels most alive in you right now?"
- Q3 "What does your system most need right now?"
- Q4 "What feels foundational to address?"
- Q5 "Where do you sense your growth edge?"

Plus the result panel copy ("Your starting node: Node N — [name]" + "Why this node?" + CTA). Edits to copy are zero-risk — `src/pages/quiz.astro` is the file; tell us which phrasings to change and we ship.

Closure tracker: IRF-III-034 / GH#56. Full memo: `docs/proofs/quiz-flow/2026-04-29-IRF-III-034-comparison.md`.

## D) GoHighLevel webhook (when ready)

The capture endpoint at `/capture` works without GHL — the quiz currently captures to nothing-durable in production (until KV is bound, see E below). When you finalize the GHL form/webhook URL, set it as a Cloudflare Pages env var:

- Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `sovereign-systems-spiral` → Settings → Environment variables → Production → Add `GHL_WEBHOOK_URL` = your URL
- No code change needed; the next deploy will route quiz + email-gate submissions to GHL automatically

---

## E) KV namespace for durable submission storage

To persist quiz/email submissions independently of GHL, provision Cloudflare KV:

- Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → Storage → KV → Create namespace named `sovereign-systems-submissions`
- Bind to the `sovereign-systems-spiral` Pages project: Settings → Bindings → KV namespace → variable name `SUBMISSIONS`

Once bound, every `/capture` POST will store the full payload under key `submission:{ISO timestamp}:{random base36}`. Until then, the multi-sink dispatch logs a one-line warning per submission and skips persistence (UX is unaffected).

---

## F) Custom domain `elevatealign.com`

Memory says this is one CF dashboard action away (Cloudflare → Pages → `sovereign-systems-spiral` → Custom Domains → Add `elevatealign.com`, follow DNS instructions). When connected, all the above URLs work at the elevatealign.com origin.

---

## G) CI deploy auth recovery (GH#52, separate vacuum)

The auto-deploy workflow has been broken since 2026-04-19 (CF API token expired). I have been deploying via local `wrangler pages deploy dist` (the `npm run deploy` script), which works but is manual.

To restore auto-deploys on push:

1. Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token
   - Permissions: Account > Cloudflare Pages > Edit
   - Account: your Cloudflare account
   - TTL: never expire (recommended) or longest you'll tolerate
2. `gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN -R organvm-iii-ergon/sovereign-systems--elevate-align` and paste the new token

Next push to `main` will trigger CI build + auto-deploy. Until then, every change ships via local `npm run deploy`.

---

## H) Hydration affiliate URLs (verify)

Three water-filter recommendations now route to live affiliate links per `src/data/hydration.config.ts`:

- IonFaucet → `https://ionfaucet.com/maddie-spiral`
- Multipure → `https://www.multipure.com/maddie-wired`
- PureHome → `https://purehome.co/maddie`

These look like real Maddie-tagged affiliate paths. Confirm they're correct (or supply replacements) and we're done.

---

## I) Untracked client docs in `docs/`

Five untracked client-deliverable files exist locally but were not committed pending your confidentiality review:

- `docs/client-deliverables/2026-04-27-revenue-agreement-final.md`
- `docs/client-orchestration-showcase.md`
- `docs/reports/2026-04-27-maddie-case-study.md`
- `docs/reports/2026-04-27-maddie-launch-checklist.md`
- `docs/reports/2026-04-27-prompt-atom-registry.md`

Tell us which (if any) are safe to commit to the public repo, vs. which need to move to a private location.
