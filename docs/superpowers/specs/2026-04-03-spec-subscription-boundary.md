# Specification: Subscription boundary and gated content model

**Issue:** #7 | **Phase:** β | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** GATED

## Context

### Why This Matters
The handoff makes subscription design an explicit content-boundary decision. Defining free vs email-gated vs paid boundaries is essential for building the correct gating infrastructure.

### Dependencies
- **Blocked by:** None
- **Blocks:** #6 (gating infrastructure), #9 (quiz routing)
- **Requires:** Decision from Maddie on what is free/paid per node

### Upstream / Downstream
- **Upstream:** Handoff
- **Downstream:** #6, #9

## Scope

### In-Scope
- Define what stays free: spiral hub, pillar overviews, hook-level content
- Define what is email-gated: node deep-dives, premium lead magnets
- Define what is paid: subscription hub, automated videos, recurring offers
- Create free/email-gated/paid matrix by page, pillar, node

### Out-of-Scope
