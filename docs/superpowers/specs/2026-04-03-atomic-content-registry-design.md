# Atomic Content Registry & Phase Strike System

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Status:** SPEC
**Depends on:** Extraction manifest (`docs/archive/extraction-manifest.md`), SOP-SS-CNT-001
**Produces:** `docs/archive/atom-registry.yaml`, coverage maps, phase strike plans
**SOP generated:** SOP-SS-ATM-001 (Atomic Decomposition & Coverage Proof)

---

## Problem

The extraction manifest (`extraction-manifest.md`) accounts for 125 files at file-level granularity. But a file is a container, not a unit of meaning. A single file may contain 3 ideas or 50. The build can't be planned at file resolution — it must be planned at *idea* resolution.

Without atom-level decomposition:
- Content injection is imprecise (which parts of a file feed which node?)
- Coverage claims are unverifiable (does "PARTIAL" mean 10% covered or 90%?)
- Provenance is ambiguous (is this Maddie's insight or ChatGPT's interpolation?)
- Phase planning is coarse (a file touches 4 nodes — which node gets it first?)

## Solution

Decompose every extracted source file into its **atomic ideas** — the smallest units of self-contained meaning. Tag each with provenance, nature, placement, and coverage state. Build coverage maps that prove exhaustive accounting. Organize atoms into phased strike plans for build execution.

---

## 1. The Atom

### Definition

An **atom** is a single contained idea: complete in itself, requiring no external context to convey its essential meaning.

### Boundary Rule

An atom ends where the next idea begins. The test is **contextual coherence**: if a sequence of sentences requires mutual presence for meaning — they cannot exist independently without losing their essential point — they form one atom. A lone sentence that stands complete is also one atom.

**One atom:**
> "Cortisol operates on a 90-second metabolic cycle. If you can hold through 90 seconds of activation without reinforcing the stress response, the cortisol wave completes and your nervous system returns to baseline. Box breathing during this window is the intervention."

Three sentences, one idea: the 90-second reset. Removing any sentence breaks the protocol.

**Two atoms:**
> "Cortisol is the primary stress hormone produced by the adrenal cortex."
>
> "The Light & Fruit Test measures morning energy, hydration clarity, and digestive response as proxy indicators of cellular health."

Two unrelated ideas that happen to be in the same file. Separate atoms.

### The coupling principle

Prefer coupled sequences over aggressive splitting. When in doubt, a cluster of 2-5 sentences that share a single point is one atom. Over-splitting into sentence-level fragments destroys the contextual coherence that makes the idea usable for build injection.

### Schema

```yaml
# --- IDENTITY ---
id: ATM-H-003                     # ATM-{category initial}-{sequence}
idea: >-
  90-second cortisol reset: box breathing through the activation window
  allows the cortisol wave to complete without reinforcement, returning
  the nervous system to parasympathetic baseline.

# --- ORIGIN (full genealogy) ---
source_file: health/cortisol-stress-carousel.md
source_document: "ChatGPT-Cortisol stress carousel.txt"
source_section: "Slide Content — The Reset"
position: 3                        # 3rd atom in this file
of_total: 7                        # file contains 7 atoms
prev_id: ATM-H-002                 # null if first in file
next_id: ATM-H-004                 # null if last in file
context_above: >-
  HPA axis feedback loop — cortisol production cycle and
  adrenal fatigue progression
context_below: >-
  IG carousel slide copy — authority tone draft with CTA
  to water funnel

# --- CLASSIFICATION ---
provenance: HYBRID                 # LOCAL | ALIEN | HYBRID
nature: PROTOCOL                   # see Nature Taxonomy below

editorial_note: >-
  Surrounding context claims "94% of disease caused by stress" — unverified.
  This atom (the reset technique) is sound; the statistic is a separate atom (ATM-H-002).

### ID Convention

`ATM-{C}-{NNN}` where:
- `C` = category initial: `H` (health), `M` (mindset), `B` (business), `W` (water), `T` (time-astro), `C` (concepts), `R` (root docs: 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b)
- `NNN` = three-digit sequence, monotonically increasing within category
- IDs are permanent — never reused, never renumbered

## 2. Provenance Taxonomy

| Value | Definition | Authority Level | Example |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| `LOCAL` | Maddie's original insight, experience, or decision — not generated by AI | Highest — client's authentic voice | Personal healing story, pricing decisions, "Feel Good First" philosophy origin |
| `HYBRID` | Maddie-directed AI output — she prompted, AI structured/expanded | Medium — AI-shaped but client-seeded | ChatGPT-generated protocols from her prompts, Gemini research summaries she requested |
| `ALIEN` | Pure AI generation with no clear Maddie input visible | Lowest — AI interpolation | Generic health facts, boilerplate definitions, AI-generated frameworks without personal direction |

### Provenance determination method

1. Read the file's prompt section (if ChatGPT/Gemini export — prompt is usually visible)
2. If Maddie's voice is in the prompt → atoms in the response are `HYBRID`
3. If the atom contains personal anecdote, first-person experience, or named decisions → `LOCAL`
4. If the atom is generic information with no personal signal → `ALIEN`
5. Files without visible prompts (`.docx`, handwritten notes) → default `LOCAL` unless clearly AI-generated

---

## 3. Nature Taxonomy

| Value | Definition | Build Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| `CLAIM` | Factual assertion that can be verified or disputed | Requires editorial review before injection |
| `FRAMEWORK` | Named conceptual structure (EAU, Feel Good First, Compound Effect) | Becomes site architecture or pillar framing |
| `TOOL` | Interactive instrument (self-assessment, tracker, checklist) | Becomes a buildable UI component or downloadable |
| `SCRIPT` | Ready-to-use copy (IG reel, caption, video script, email) | Injects directly into content or social pipeline |
| `STATISTIC` | Specific number with (claimed) source | Requires citation verification |
| `PROTOCOL` | Step-by-step actionable technique or process | Becomes node deep-dive content |
| `NARRATIVE` | Personal story, healing journey, testimonial | Becomes brand voice / about page / video content |
| `CITATION` | Reference to published research, book, or study | Feeds research-citations.md, supports CLAIMs |
| `PRODUCT` | Standalone product concept (book, course, ebook, planner) | Feeds product roadmap (GH#10, GH#19, GH#20) |
| `MODEL` | Business/revenue/funnel model or strategy | Feeds financial pillar, GHL integration, pricing |
| `QUESTION` | Open question Maddie asked that remains unanswered | Feeds client decision tracker (SOP-SS-CLT-001) |
| `INSTRUCTION` | Build directive from Maddie to the developer | Feeds issue specs and build plans directly |

## 4. Document Decomposition Method

### Layer 1: Document Envelope

Each of the 125 extracted files gets a document-level record:

```yaml
document:
  id: DOC-H-08
  source_file: health/cortisol-stress-carousel.md
  original_file: "ChatGPT-Cortisol stress carousel.txt"
  category: health
  readiness: Ready
  total_sections: 3
  total_atoms: 7
  dominant_provenance: HYBRID
  dominant_nature: SCRIPT
  sections:
    - name: "Cortisol Science"
      atom_range: [ATM-H-001, ATM-H-003]
    - name: "IG Carousel Slides"
      atom_range: [ATM-H-004, ATM-H-005]
    - name: "Caption Drafts"
      atom_range: [ATM-H-006, ATM-H-007]
```

### Layer 2: Section Identification

**ChatGPT exports** (.txt): Sections delimited by `##` headers, `---` dividers, or topic shifts. Most follow: `Prompt → Response → Follow-up`.

**Gemini exports** (.md): Sections delimited by `##` headers. Usually: `Prompt → Response`.

**DocX conversions** (1a, 1b, Hormones, Rhythms, ERW): Internal numbered sections, named parts, headers. These are the most structurally rich documents.

**Files with no structure** (raw brainstorms, single-thought exports): One implicit section: `"Content"`.

### Layer 3: Atom Extraction

Within each section, read sequentially and identify atom boundaries using the coherence test:

1. Does this sentence introduce a new idea distinct from what precedes it? → New atom
2. Does this sentence extend, qualify, or complete the preceding idea? → Same atom
3. Is this a transitional/filler sentence between ideas? → Attach to whichever idea it serves

### Processing Order

1. Root documents first (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b) — these contain architecture-level atoms that contextualize everything else
2. `Ready` files by category (33 files) — highest build priority
3. `Partial` files by category (46 files) — some atoms are build-ready even if the file isn't
4. `Raw` files by category (34 files) — ideas exist but are unpolished
5. `Empty`/`N/A` files (10 files) — document envelope only, zero atoms

### Estimated atom counts

| Category | Files | Est. atoms/file | Est. total |
|----------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| Root docs (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b) | 4 | 50-150 | ~400 |
| health/ (+.docx) | 31 | 5-20 | ~300 |
| mindset/ (+.docx) | 39 | 5-15 | ~350 |
| business/ | 15 | 3-10 | ~100 |
| water/ (+.docx) | 16 | 5-15 | ~150 |
| time-astro/ | 9 | 3-10 | ~50 |
| concepts/ | 13 | 3-10 | ~70 |
| **Total** | **127** | | **~1,420** |

Doc 1b alone (10,393 lines) may contain 100-150 atoms — it's the client's complete brain dump.

## 5. Coverage Maps

### Purpose

Prove that every atom is accounted for. "No stones unturned" = `Unaccounted: 0`.

### Map 1: By Node

For each of the 13 spiral nodes, list every atom that maps to it:

```
Node 1 — Feel Good First
  Total atoms: 47
  EXISTS: 2 (physical.md references the concept)
  PARTIAL: 8 (branches mention related topics)
  MISSING: 37 (not yet in build)
  Coverage: 4.3% full, 21.3% partial
```

### Map 2: By Pillar

```
Physical Sovereignty (Nodes 1-5)
  Total atoms: ~380
  LOCAL: 34 | HYBRID: 298 | ALIEN: 48
  CLAIM: 67 (12 FLAGGED) | FRAMEWORK: 8 | TOOL: 15 | SCRIPT: 23 | ...
```

### Map 3: By Provenance

Cross-cutting view — where is Maddie's authentic voice vs AI expansion?

```
LOCAL: ~120 atoms — Maddie's own insights, stories, decisions
  → These are the HIGHEST PRIORITY for build injection
  → They cannot be recreated or approximated
  → They ARE the brand

HYBRID: ~950 atoms — Maddie-directed AI output
  → Bulk of content, structured from her prompts
  → Usable with editorial review
  → May need voice refinement to match LOCAL tone

ALIEN: ~350 atoms — Pure AI generation
  → Background research, generic health facts
  → Lowest priority for direct injection
  → Useful as citation/support material
```

### Map 4: By Nature

What *types* of content exist in the corpus?

```
CLAIM: ~200 atoms (47 FLAGGED → editorial review required)
PROTOCOL: ~150 atoms (highest build value — these become node deep-dives)
SCRIPT: ~120 atoms (IG reels, captions, video scripts → social pipeline)
FRAMEWORK: ~80 atoms (named systems → site architecture)
TOOL: ~60 atoms (assessments, trackers → buildable components)
NARRATIVE: ~50 atoms (personal stories → brand voice, about page)
...
```

### Map 5: Unaccounted Proof

Final proof instrument:

```
Total atoms registered: 1,420
Assigned to strike phase: 1,410
Intentionally excluded (Empty/N/A/Duplicate): 10
Unaccounted: 0

PROOF COMPLETE
```
