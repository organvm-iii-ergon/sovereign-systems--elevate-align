# Spiral Experiments — Confluence × Apophatic (2026-05-16)

## Why this folder exists (read this first if you're Maddie)

You said in iMessage 2026-05-16: *"I love love love timelines."* You said this after 4jp told you *"I'm gonna have a client function so we can have each design iteration on a timeline for you to be able to see each version over time."*

This folder is the substrate for that. Every batch of spiral-evolution experiments now lands in `docs/spiral-experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-{theme}/`. You will eventually be able to browse them as a versioned gallery on the live site — for now, they live here as the source-of-truth snapshots. Each `.html` file in this folder **is a playable artifact** — open it directly in a browser to interact with that version.

The current production spiral on `elevatealign.com` is its own thing (the tapered helix with chakra-color nodes). This folder is the **lab** where alternative geometries get tested before any are promoted into the live spiral.

## Why this batch exists (4jp's research framing)

The batch explores a single seed image — *"three glowing cubes at the top (cross/crescent/wheel, blue aura), three at the bottom (om/cross/crescent, purple aura), with a six-loop spiral orbited by twelve glowing spheres holding twelve lanes each, rainbow-hued nanobot souls, dual gradients, spiritual text"* — across three escalating modes of prompting and two complementary philosophies (kataphatic / apophatic, i.e. positive-rendering vs negative-aniconic).

The point is **not** to pick a winner. The point is to develop the substrate-vocabulary (per `~/CLAUDE.md` substrate anchor: σ-axis, POV-tetrad, Alchemical I/O) that lets us reason about WHY different prompt shapes generate different outputs from the same seed.

## How to read the snapshot index

Each file below is a snapshot. The classification tag (`[PROMPT]`, `[PHILOSOPHY]`, `[OUTPUT]`, `[ARTIFACT]`, `[TRANSCRIPT]`) tells you what *kind* of thing it is. The lineage column tells you what other files it relates to.

`[ARTIFACT]` files are the playable HTML — those are the snapshots you'd want to scrub through in a timeline view. The `.md` files give context.

## The Three Prompts (escalating openness)

These are the input prompts 4jp gave to Claude/Gemini. Same seed image, three different scaffolds:

| File | Bytes | What it does | Lineage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `minimal_seed_prompt.md` | 1.1 KB | The seed described, ends with one question: *"what is this?"* Smallest scaffold, asks for being-naming not making. | seed |
| `cross_pollination_prompt.md` | 2.7 KB | The seed described + explicit "do NOT render this" instruction + invitation to propose what it *wants* to be. Medium scaffold, asks for transmutation. | sibling of minimal_seed |
| `unscaffolded_prompt.md` | 1.1 KB | The seed described + literally only "Respond." Zero scaffold, asks for whatever-the-model-is. | sibling of minimal_seed |

These three prompts are an experiment in **prompt-shape × response-shape** correspondence. They are the input layer for everything else in this folder.

## The Two Philosophies (kataphatic / apophatic — the polarity axis)

The same seed produced two opposite design philosophies:

| File | Bytes | Mode | What it argues |
|---|---|---|---|
| `confluence-philosophy.md` | 4.8 KB | **kataphatic** (positive, visible) | The "Confluence" philosophy. Every sacred motion that *can* be made visible *should* be made visible. Six concentric orbital loops, twelve stations, 144 streaming lanes, dual triads breathing as hexagram. Asserts kataphasis as vow: *"It does not need to know the other exists. But it is built so that anyone who knows both might feel, in the visible mandala, the shape of what has been deliberately left unrendered elsewhere."* |
| `pf-005-philosophy.md` | 4.6 KB | **kataphatic** (alternate phrasing) | The "Twelvefold Confluence" — same kataphatic position re-phrased as a movement/manifesto. Companion read to `confluence-philosophy.md`. |
| `apophatic_engine_spec.md` | 14.4 KB | **apophatic** (negative, aniconic) | The "Apophatic Engine" — explicit inversion of PF-005. Refuses image. Text-only contemplative architecture. Sister document. The pair (kataphatic + apophatic) is the polarity axis being explored, not two alternatives to pick between. |

## The Five Outputs (claude.ai session deliverables)

These are content summaries / responses Claude produced when given the prompts above, plus remix work:

| File | Bytes | Source date | What it is | Iteration trail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Algorithmic-art.md` | 6.2 KB | 2026-05-16 10:29:35 | First-round algorithmic-art summary | (1 of 2) |
| `Algorithmic-art (1).md` | 5.1 KB | 2026-05-16 10:30:23 | Second-round of same — see what changed | (2 of 2) |
| `Sacred-Geometric-Energy-Visualization.md` | 21.3 KB | 2026-05-16 10:27:22 | First-round sacred-geometric visualization output | (1 of 2) |
| `Sacred-Geometric-Energy-Visualization (1).md` | 24.1 KB | 2026-05-16 10:32:32 | Second-round — longer, more detailed | (2 of 2) |
| `Remix-of-Mystical-Energy-Canvas-with-Sacred-Symbols.md` | 3.5 KB | 2026-05-16 10:28:39 | Description of the canvas-remix variant — feeds into the `mystical_energy_canvas` HTML series and the `remixed-d00fdcac` family |

## The Nine Playable Artifacts (HTML — open these in a browser)

This is the **snapshot timeline** for Maddie. Open any `.html` directly; each is self-contained. The numbered suffixes are sequential iterations:

| File | KB | Lines | What you'll see | Position in iteration trail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mystical_energy_canvas.html` | 9.7 | 253 | The minimal seed-render — smallest, simplest version | **v1** (canvas series) |
| `mystical_energy_canvas (1).html` | 22.2 | 602 | More developed — added motion, more elements | **v2** (canvas series) |
| `mystical_energy_canvas (2).html` | 37.8 | 1040 | Further developed — richer particle system | **v3** (canvas series) |
| `mystical_energy_canvas (3).html` | 39.0 | 1222 | Most developed of base canvas series | **v4** (canvas series) |
| `remixed-d00fdcac.html` | 39.0 | 1222 | Remix variant — different aesthetic, same seed | **v1** (remix series) |
| `remixed-d00fdcac (1).html` | 45.0 | 1179 | Remix iteration | **v2** (remix series) |
| `confluence.html` | 33.4 | 827 | Implementation of the `confluence-philosophy.md` — the kataphatic vision rendered | kataphatic implementation |
| `pf-005-twelvefold-confluence.html` | 31.9 | 818 | Implementation of `pf-005-philosophy.md` — the Twelvefold Confluence rendered | kataphatic alt-phrasing impl |
| `apophatic-engine-cell.html` | 5.0 | 198 | Implementation cell of `apophatic_engine_spec.md` — the negative/aniconic side. Deliberately minimal. | apophatic implementation |

## The Four Gemini Transcripts (next-door, in `docs/archive/2026-05/`)

Filed adjacent to this batch because they're the conversational substrate that produced some of the experiment thinking:

| File at `docs/archive/2026-05/` | KB | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `2026-05-16-gemini-interactive-3d-theoretical-reality-render.md` | 48.5 | Primary Gemini transcript: 4jp's expert-transcription-assistant prompt + the unfolding 3D-theoretical-reality-render exchange |
| `2026-05-16-gemini-interactive-3d-theoretical-reality-render-obsidian.md` | 40.0 | Same content, Obsidian-flavored export |
| `2026-05-16-gemini-interactive-3d-theoretical-reality-render-v2.md` | 6.2 | Condensed re-run / variant |
| `2026-05-16-gemini-error-encountered.md` | 1.4 | Gemini error stub — kept as evidence-of-attempt; sometimes the failure is the data |

## Convention for future snapshot batches

This folder establishes a pattern. Going forward, any cohort of spiral-evolution research should:

1. **Land in `docs/spiral-experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-{theme}/`** — date + 2-3 word theme.
2. **Carry a `README.md`** structured like this one — prompts, philosophies, outputs, artifacts, lineage table.
3. **Preserve iteration suffixes** (`(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)`) — DO NOT renumber them; the suffix IS the version index Maddie scrubs through.
4. **Cross-link the predecessor batch** at the top, so the lineage is walk-able backward.
5. **Cross-link to `docs/timelines/`** — when a batch is significant enough to feed the evolution timeline, file a new row in the most recent timeline doc OR create a new timeline file.
6. **Never delete a snapshot** — Universal Rule (additive only). If a snapshot is later considered "wrong," annotate WHY in this README, don't remove the file.

## Follow-on issues to file (4jp action)

- **Maddie-facing timeline UI** — these HTML files need to be browse-able on the live site (likely a `/lab/` or `/spiral-experiments/` route under `src/pages/` that lists batches and embeds them via iframe or links them via download). Currently they're filesystem-only and not served by Astro.
- **Promotion path** — which experiments graduate from `docs/spiral-experiments/` into `src/components/spiral/` as production code? No path defined yet.
- **Substrate vocabulary mapping** — these experiments invoke σ-axis, POV-tetrad, Alchemical I/O terminology (per `~/CLAUDE.md` substrate anchor). A mapping doc connecting *which experiment instantiates which substrate primitive* would close a known gap.

## Cross-references

- **Predecessor batch (Apr 1 → May 1):** `docs/timelines/2026-05-01-spiral-evolution-timeline.md` (7 rounds, 56 commits)
- **Today's Maddie iMessage transcript** (where the "I love love love timelines" line lives): `docs/maddie/2026-05-16-maddie-imessage-transcript-and-signals.md`
- **Production spiral source-of-truth:** `src/components/spiral/spiral.ts`
- **Convention parent:** `~/CLAUDE.md` "Plan File Discipline" (this is the *experiments* counterpart — same "never overwrite, version forward" discipline applied to playable artifacts).
