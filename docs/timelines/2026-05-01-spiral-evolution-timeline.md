# Spiral Artifact Evolution Timeline

**Date range:** 2026-04-01 → 2026-05-01
**Scope:** Sovereign Systems Spiral hero artifact (`src/components/spiral/spiral.ts` + adjacent data layers)

**Source quality:** Maddie quotes verbatim from preserved iMessage extracts and dated decision docs. 4jp prompts verbatim from the pre-assessed weekly prompt corpus (`meta-organvm/organvm-corpvs-testamentvm/data/corpora/week-2026-04-19_to_2026-04-26/prompts-raw.jsonl` — 108 spiral-cwd prompts) and from the Codex CLI specstory exports (`.specstory/history/*.md`, 38 files). Voice-to-text artifacts in Maddie messages are preserved as-is — the noise is signal. Long 4jp prompts truncated to first ~300 chars + `[...]` + last ~50 chars; verbatim fragments preserved.

But maybe can we switch the cross and the heart for something a little less generic (idk the right way to say it lol) more traditional/stoic maybe ahaha idkkk but we really don't have to get crazy with it if it's too hard we could even just do little glowing orbs with the sparkles around it and then the name pop up on the hover in the middle too sounds cute! But I think it's cute right now too lol j happy with it" |  |  |
| 2026-04-25 | "I do like the chakra colors and how they are right now! Maybe just add in another shade of orange instead of three purple and then we can make the most top purple a little lighter!?" |  |  |
| 2026-04-25 | "Is this what I'm seeing now? Or you're saying like real stars they're all different a little - cause if that's what you're saying then YES lol could even just do the color so they're orb like but stars and then word pops up in center or under on hover !?!?!" — and: "And i absolutely love the each symbol being from a different religion - chefs kiss !!!" — and: "Omg okay I think you read my brain !!!

## Round 7 — May 1 today (the "easily identifiable / enough differential" message)

| Date | Maddie's request/feedback (verbatim) | 4jp's prompt to Claude/agents (verbatim) | Version shipped (commit hash + one-line description) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-01 | (Maddie msg 2 of four — voice-to-text) "I just want them to be easily identifiable / enough differential that you can tell they're different... Even if it's just the distinct colors or shapes or whatever it is." |  | (pending — Track A1: hybrid blend opacity 30% → 55–60%; Track A2: default `'hybrid'` → `'visible'`; Track A3: activate `makeGeometryFromPrimitives()`) |
| 2026-05-01 | (msg 3 — water page critique) "the biggest issue with my ZIP Code is fluoride and I didn't see that pop-up. Fluoride is a very specific filter that you have to get a specific filter for so a lot of people spend a shit ton of money on the wrong filters and they don't even filter out what they want to filter." |  | (pending — Track D bug investigation in `functions/api/water-report.ts` parser + effects map) |
| 2026-05-01 | "I have a whole bottle of water section cause I have a bunch of information on this smart water horse water you could be drinking. They have the best marketing, but it is the most acidic and dehydrating and so like that also various headache this put sodium in their water so just like little things like that we could even add." |  | (pending — Track C bottled-truth content) |
| 2026-05-01 | "I do not think the prices of the water or the bottles water pricing is right I tried to work with chat and it was not having it so if I need to go into the store myself..." |  | (pending — Track B `BottledWaterCost` schema + externalization) |
| 2026-05-01 | (msg 4) "I want to get you over the pre-filter like affiliate link for each today." |  | (pending — Track E URL swap when Maddie sends links) |

### Gaps and known limitations

- **2026-04-26 → 2026-04-28**: pre-assessed corpus stops at 2026-04-26; specstory files for 04-27 were workspace-meta sessions (`at-claude-prompts-maddie.md`, `find-all-applicable-drive.md`), not spiral-specific. No spiral commits in this window — quiet days.
- **04-25 evening 22:00–23:00 prompts**: a handful of meta prompts ("dude i said we're working on maddie in another session", "sovereign spiral is someone else's task u work elsewhere") show 4jp orchestrating multiple parallel sessions — the actual V5 cascade prompts are interleaved with cross-stream coordination. Where attribution is ambiguous, the prompt is included only if the timestamp aligns with a spiral commit within ±5 minutes.
- **Round 4 V5.1, V5.4, V5.6 commits** have no captured prompt — these were autonomous reshape passes within a single Claude session triggered by the 22:48 "Halloween Town / Tomorrowland" anchor prompt. Empty cells are deliberate, not omissions.
- **Round 6 commits 1716d26 / dcfe59f / ae8c420** ("nonprofit-mission framing", "Maddie-tagged affiliate URLs", "MANDORLA + TETRAD primitives") are spiral-adjacent (config + content) but not strictly the spiral artifact; they are listed to keep the Round 6 commit set chronologically continuous, not because they are spiral-render changes.

## Counts

- **Total Maddie quotes (verbatim):** 19 (Round 1: 5; Round 2: 1; Round 3: 5; Round 4: 0; Round 5: 0; Round 6: 0; Round 7: 5; spread across multi-message threads with ~8 inline message segments).
- **Total 4jp prompts (verbatim):** 30 (Round 1: 9; Round 2: 5; Round 3: 2; Round 4: 6; Round 5: 4; Round 6: 4; Round 7: 0). Spiral-cwd prompt corpus contains 108 entries 04-19 → 04-25; this timeline cites the subset directly anchored to a commit or to a Maddie-thread.
- **Total commits:** 56 spiral-relevant commits between 2026-04-19 and 2026-04-30 (Round 1: 11; Round 2: 9; Round 3: 4; Round 4: 14; Round 5: 9; Round 6: 9). Round 7 has no commits yet.
