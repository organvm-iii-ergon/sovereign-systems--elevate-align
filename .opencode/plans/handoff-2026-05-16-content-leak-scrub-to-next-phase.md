# Agent Handoff: Content Leak Scrub → Next Phase

**From:** Claude Opus 4.7 session | **Date:** 2026-05-16 | **Phase:** Post-Cleanup / Carry-Forward

## Current State

**Repository:** `organvm/sovereign-systems--elevate-align` (origin/main, clean parity)

**What exists right now:**
- 3 PRs merged this session (#84/#85/#86 — all on origin/main)
- `.conductor/active-handoff.md` refreshed (old one archived)
- Working tree carries 2 pre-existing parallel-session items (UNCOMMITTED):
  - `R .conductor/active-handoff.md → archive-2026-05-16-post-cf-rotation-handoff.md`
  - `?? .conductor/active-handoff.md`
  - `D docs/maddie/2026-04-25-message-spiral-feedback.pdf` (pre-existing)
  - `?? docs/client-pdfs/2026-05-16-maddie-imessage-responses.pdf` (pre-existing)
- No plan files authored (memory-as-plan pattern)
- `prompt-atoms.json` not touched

**Git parity:** main ↔ origin/main = 0/0 ✓

## Completed Work

- [x] Content leak scrub — 3 PRs merged (#84/#85/#86)
- [x] Maddie inflow: 3-branch curation + filter UI hide + URL + quiz UX
- [x] Branch visibility: keep 3 (Inflammation, Hormone Health, Energy+Focus), rename, hide filters
- [x] Hide filter recommendations only (keep cost breakdown per voice note)
- [x] Write outbound: VA-access logistics + branch-swap confirmation
- [x] .conductor/active-handoff.md refreshed from CF-rotation handoff
- [x] Closeout doc written: `~/.claude/plans/closeout-2026-05-16-content-leak-scrub.md`
- [x] Session memory + 2 feedback memories updated

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Destructive rewrite held on GitHub history | 4 relocated docs/internal/ files still exposed; rewrite requires explicit authorization |
| Memory-as-plan pattern | No separate plan files; durable artifact is session memory + feedback memories |
| Never push as part of closeout | Handoff refresh UNCOMMITTED per /closeout rule |
| CLAUDE.md autogen gate script missing | Gate script not installed at `/Users/4jp/.local/bin/claude-md-autogen-gate`; 32 days stale |

## Critical Context

- **IP boundary:** content = client IP (do not distribute or reuse); code/architecture = studio IP
- **Maddie messages:** HOLD (paste first) + CLEAR (paste after ack) both delivered via SendUserFile. Production verified clean.
- **Advisor called:** 1 time before substantive cleanup. All 5 recommendations load-bearing.
- **16GB RAM constraint** on host machine (macOS 26 Tahoe Beta, Apple Silicon M3)

## Next Actions (Carry-Forward)

1. **PR-cascade active-handoff refresh** (branch: `chore/refresh-active-handoff-post-leak-scrub`)
   - Awaiting explicit user authorization
   - This is the 1 authorized action remaining from closeout

2. **GitHub history rewrite** (held)
   - 4 relocated `docs/internal/` files still exposed in GitHub history
   - Destructive operation — requires explicit client approval

3. **CLAUDE.md autogen freshness gate**
   - Gate script missing at `/Users/4jp/.local/bin/claude-md-autogen-gate`
   - 32 days stale — needs installation or alternative approach

4. **Dependabot recommendation** (open task)
   - `npm update astro @astrojs/cloudflare`

5. **Working tree cleanup**
   - 2 pre-existing parallel-session items need resolution
   - PDF file moves in `docs/` directory

## Risks & Warnings

- **Destructive history rewrite** — force push required; coordinate with any parallel sessions
- **UNCOMMITTED handoff** — `.conductor/active-handoff.md` changes will be lost if not committed
- **16GB RAM constraint** — max 4-6 concurrent agents; avoid spawning too many parallel processes
- **Beta macOS** — GPU/WindowServer instability possible

## Recovery Protocol

If state mismatch detected:
1. Check `git log` for recent activity since this handoff
2. Verify `.conductor/` directory state matches expected
3. Check if PR-cascade branch was created/merged
4. Re-verify carry-forward items still relevant
